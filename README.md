# Airline Flight Delay Predictions

## Description

The goal of the study was to examine the most relevant variables for determining flight
delays and apply appropriate data mining techniques to construct the best fit predictive model.
Models were trained using the Naïve Bayes, CART, C5.0, Random Forest, and Neural Network
classification approaches, and each model’s capabilities were assessed. These models were then
evaluated using various performance metrics to determine which method yielded the best
results.
